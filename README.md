# Brackets Darker

This extention tries to make the [brackets](http://brackets.io/) UI darker
and some visibility improvements on Linux.

The following enhancements are applied:

* Hide the file name from top titlebar
* Reduce the top titlebar height
* Dark titlebar, statusbar & empty editor area
* Override fonts (Droid Sans, Ubuntu, Dejavu Sans)
* Base16 Dark Themes (selected)

The extension is compatible with other theme extensions and only applies
the base16 themes if custom theme is not loaded by any other extension.
